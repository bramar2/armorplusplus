# armorplusplus
This is a plugin where i recreates the famous BlockArmor mod. You can download the plugin at spigotmc.org/resources/armorplusplus.74748/

fyi, i did not copy and paste one by one the recipe and abilities of the armor. I used a program called ArmorCreator (which i made) to automatically create them for me.
If you want to see the program, there is.
