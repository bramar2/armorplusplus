# armorplusplus
This is a plugin where i recreates the famous BlockArmor mod. You can download the plugin at spigotmc.org/resources/armorplusplus.74748

fyi, i did not copy and paste one by one the recipe and abilities of the armor. I used a program called ArmorCreator (which i made) to automatically create them for me.
If you want to see the program, there is.

If you download the program i made, it might give you a warning that it might be dangerous. It's actually not dangerous. If you want to make sure it's safe, scan it using an antivirus.
( The program has been removed. It's detected as a "Dangerous" file but also you can only run it if you have Python. Don't know about python? It's a programming language. Wikipedia Page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language) )

EDIT: im sorry for those who really wants a full version of ArmorPlusPlus, but i have quitted minecraft. For the past 3 months, i haven't updated my plugin. And for now, i am fully abandoning this plugin forever or until i came back to minecraft - Me, 5/19/2020
