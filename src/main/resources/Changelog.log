Current Version: 0.5.1
Targeted Version: 0.6.5

Changelog:
- 'tick-interval' configuration is now removed. The ability system is changed.
- Ability system is now based off events except for the PlayerLandEvent which is for every 5 ticks, cactus armor, and tick-based changing armors (every 2-6 second or 40-120 ticks).
The plugin shouldnt cause as much lag as before.
- All the tick-based armors now run in a single for-loop instead of multiple for-loops making it more optimised? idk whats the word for this
- Note armor fixed not working.
- Y Velocity for arrows in dispenser armor is now higher.
- Added configuration 'disabled-items' for custom items.
- Added the witch potion crafted by a potion (any) and 8 glowstone surrounding it.
  Effects: 15s Regen 2, 7s Speed 2, 1m Absorption, 20s Strength
- Removal of command /armorplusplus config for reason: Too glitchy and too many bugs to fix rather than
  just configuring it and doing /armorplusplus reload
- Added: Witch armor - Crafted like normally but using witch potions. It makes your effects last double
  as long!
- Nerfed obsidian armor KB resistance from 7.5 (literally AntiKB) to 1 (netherite)
- Added /armorplusplus items for custom items
- Update checker now gives more specific info, like download url, author, update title, update changelog, etc
- Minor changes: Piston armor now display the correct entities pushed, plugin is now configured in maven,
  , disabled armor and items now have a different optimised way of checking, lapis armor now actually
  listens for 'LAPIS' id instead of 'DIRT', and /armorplusplus give now gives custom items.
